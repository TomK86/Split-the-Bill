### Introduction

You've just finished a big meal with a big group of people.  Everyone is full and happy, but ready to go home.  You ask for the bills, but... there's only one!  Now instead of relaxing after a great meal, you're scratching your head trying to do complicated math so that each person only pays for what they're responsible for.

Has this ever happened to you?  It's happened to me many times, so I decided to create SplitTheBill.  This app makes the process of splitting a complicated restaurant bill much easier by guiding you through it in a step-by-step manner and displaying detailed results on-screen for everyone to see.

### How to Use

All you need is your bill and your Android mobile device!  You can either split the entire bill evenly among all of your party members, or you can go through each line item and select one or more party members to pay for it.  You can even split an individual line item up so that party members only pay for the quantity they are responsible for!

##### Split a Bill Evenly

To split a bill evenly among all party members, simply tap the "Evenly" button on the home screen.  Next, type in the grand total (after tax) at the bottom of your bill.  Select the number of people in your party, then tap the "Split" button.  Your results will be displayed at the bottom of the screen.

##### Split a Bill by Line Item

To split a bill so that each party member only pays for the line items they are responsible for, just tap the "By Line Item" button on the home screen.  On this screen, you can tap the "Edit Party" button to add and remove members from your party, or you can tap the "Edit Bill" button to add and remove line items from your bill.  Once you've finished creating your party and bill, type in the local sales tax percentage and press the "Split" button.  You will be asked to select one line item at a time from your bill.  For each selected line item, you will be asked to select the party member(s) who are responsible for it.  You can then choose to split the total cost of the selected line item evenly among the selected party members, or break it down further so that each member only pays for the quantity they are responsible for.  Once you've finished assigning payments to each line item on your bill, you can either edit a line item by selecting it again or just press the "Finish" button to return to the main screen and show the amount each party member is responsible for, as well as a handy tip guide.

##### International Use

All currency displayed by SplitTheBill is automatically adjusted according to your mobile device's regional metadata.  This means that any currency amount displayed by the app will automatically be converted to your local currency.  The app does **not** use your GPS location information; rather, it pulls metadata from the device itself about what general geographical region you are located in, and updates the displayed currency accordingly.

This app is currently only available in English.  Please be aware that tipping customs vary internationally, so the tip guide included in the results may or may not be relevant to your local customs.
